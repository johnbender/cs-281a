\begin{enumerate}
  \item Given any languages $L_1, L_2 \in \NP$, prove that $L_1 \cup L_2 \in \NP$
    \begin{proof}
      We must show that there exists a polynomial time $M_3$ such that:

      \begin{align}
        x \in (L_1 \cup L_2) \iff \exists u.M_3(x,u) = 1
      \end{align}

      By the definition of \NP\ and the membership of both $L_1$ and $L_2$ in \NP\  we know that there exist two polynomial time Turing machines, $M_1$ and $M_2$, such that:

      \begin{align}
        x \in L_1 \iff \exists u.M_1(x,u) = 1 \\
        x \in L_2 \iff \exists u.M_2(x,u) = 1
      \end{align}

      Further by the definition of set union we have:

      \begin{align}
        L_1 \cup L_2 = \{ x : x \in L_1 \lor x \in L_2 \}
      \end{align}

      By (1.3) we can characterize the problem as follows:

      \begin{align}
        x \in L_1 \lor x \in L_2 \iff \exists u.M_1(x,u) = 1 \lor  M_2(x,u) = 1
      \end{align}

      In which case we can define $M_3$ to first try $x,u$ with $M_1$ and then $M_2$ if necessary. Since both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are polynomial time executing them in sequence is also polynomial time, thus $M_3$ is a polynomial time Turing machine that verifies for $L_1 \cup L_2$.


    \end{proof}

    \newpage

  \item Let $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ and $g : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ be time-constructible. Prove that the following functions are also time-constructible: (a) $f + g$; (b) $f \cdot g$.
  \item Define $T : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ by $T(n) = max_{\alpha,x}\{T_{\alpha}(x) : T_{\alpha}(x) < \infty \}$, where $\alpha$ and $x$ range over all Boolean strings of length at most $n$, and $T_{\alpha}(x)$ denotes the running time of $M_{\alpha}$ on $x$. Prove that no Turing machine can compute $T$.

    \begin{proof}
      We assume $T$ is computable for the sake of contradiction. Then there exists a Turing machine $M_T$ that computes $T$. Further, there exists a binary string representation $\lfloor M_T \rfloor$ for $M_T$ of bounded length (TODO cite lemma/proof from book?).

      Next we select $n$ of sufficient length such that $T(n)$ must consider a Turing machine $M_{\beta}$ that accommodates the definition of $M_T$ and takes the following steps for an input $x \in \{0,1\}^n$:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Simulate $M_T$ on input $n = |x|$, obtaining the maximum running time of all Turing machines $M$ of length $n$.
        \item Write ones to a work tape recording the number written until it exceeds the value of the simulation of $M_T$ with $n$.
      \end{enumerate}

      Now, the result for $n$ must be $T(n) = T_{\beta}(x)$ for $|x| = n$ but then $T_{\beta}(x) > T(|x|)$ by (b), a contradiction.

    \end{proof}

\end{enumerate}
